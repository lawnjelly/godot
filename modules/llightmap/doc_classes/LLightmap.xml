		Creates lightmaps and ambient occlusion for scenes.
Version 0.1.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This node can unmap scenes for lightmapping, generate both lighting and ambient occlusion, and generate light probe data for realtime dynamic lighting. Lighting can use forward tracing (from the light) or backward tracing (from the surface to the light). Lighting and ambient occlusion are stored in linear intermediate exr files, which can be combined to form a final gamma corrected texture, either exr or png.

		<member name="a_bounce_power" type="float" setter="set_ambient_bounce_power" getter="get_ambient_bounce_power" default="0.5">
			Contribution of each ambient bounce relative to the scene.
		</member>
		<member name="a_bounce_samples" type="int" setter="set_num_ambient_bounce_samples" getter="get_num_ambient_bounce_samples" default="128">
			Number of samples for each ambient bounce.
		</member>
		<member name="a_bounces" type="int" setter="set_num_ambient_bounces" getter="get_num_ambient_bounces" default="0">
			Sets the number of ambient bounces. These are done after the initial lightmap is created, and can efficiently estimate ambient light. They do however take no account of source ray direction, so are purely diffuse.
		</member>
		<member name="ao_filename" type="String" setter="set_ao_filename" getter="get_ao_filename" default="&quot;&quot;">
			Filename for ambient occlusion exr file. This is usually used as an intermediate for producing the combined final lightmap. There is no need to ship this with your project.
		</member>
		<member name="ao_light_ratio" type="float" setter="set_light_ao_ratio" getter="get_light_ao_ratio" default="0.5">
			Ratio between ambient occlusion and lights in the final merged file. 0 is ambient occlusion only, 0.5 is an equal mix, and 1 is lights only.
		</member>
		<member name="ao_range" type="float" setter="set_ao_range" getter="get_ao_range" default="2.0">
			Ambient occlusion is calculated by testing rays for a fixed distance (range) for hits against other geometry. The best range will depend on the size of your geometry, and the look you are going for.
		</member>
		<member name="ao_samples" type="int" setter="set_ao_num_samples" getter="get_ao_num_samples" default="256">
			Number of samples used per texel. A larger number will give more accurate results, but will take longer to bake.
		</member>
		<member name="bake_mode" type="int" setter="set_bake_mode" getter="get_bake_mode" enum="LLightmap.eBakeMode" default="1">
			Selects whether to uvmap, bake lightmaps, bake ambient occlusion, merge intermediates, or bake both.
[b]WARNING[/b] - Be sure to consult the help file before using uvmap.
		</member>
		<member name="bounce_power" type="float" setter="set_bounce_power" getter="get_bounce_power" default="1.0">
			Typically light power is lost at each bounce. This can be modified by increasing the amount of light at each bounce (above 1.0) or decreasing. This can be used to give a different look to your lightmaps.
		</member>
		<member name="combined_filename" type="String" setter="set_combined_filename" getter="get_combined_filename" default="&quot;&quot;">
			Filename for the final lightmap, combining lights and ambient occlusion (or just one of these). This can be exr format (linear) or png, with gamma applied.
		</member>
		<member name="dilate" type="bool" setter="set_dilate" getter="get_dilate" default="true">
			Dilation is a post process filter than expands the color at the edge of uv islands into the unused gutter pixels. Although these pixels appear useless, they are actually sampled during texture filtering, and especially using mipmaps, so having them roughly match the edge colors can prevent ugly artifacts at seams.
		</member>
		<member name="emission_density" type="float" setter="set_emission_density" getter="get_emission_density" default="1.0">
			Allows increasing or decreasing the number of samples used for emission, in relation to the overall primary number of samples. This can be used to relatively increase emission quality, or decrease bake times.
		</member>
		<member name="gamma" type="float" setter="set_gamma" getter="get_gamma" default="2.2">
			During merging to a final png file, it is advised to apply gamma, because the source texture will normally be expected to be sRGB (gamma 2.2) rather than linear, which is necessary for lighting calculations. You can vary this to get a different look.
		</member>
		<member name="glow" type="float" setter="set_glow" getter="get_glow" default="1.0">
			Determines the balance between light at an emission surface, and the light emitted from it.
		</member>
		<member name="lightmap_filename" type="String" setter="set_lightmap_filename" getter="get_lightmap_filename" default="&quot;&quot;">
			Filename for baked lights exr file. This is usually used as an intermediate for producing the combined final lightmap. There is no need to ship this with your project.
		</member>
		<member name="lights" type="NodePath" setter="set_lights_path" getter="get_lights_path" default="NodePath(&quot;&quot;)">
			This is the branch which contains the lights you intend to use. They must be set to 'bake indirect' or 'bake all' in the light setting, in order to affect the lightmap. This branch can be the same as the meshes, or a different branch.
		</member>
		<member name="material_size" type="int" setter="set_material_size" getter="get_material_size" default="256">
			In order to sample material colors in bounced light, downsized versions of the original textures can be used, for greater speed, less memory use and less aliasing. This determines the maximum size of the texture.
		</member>
		<member name="max_light_distance" type="int" setter="set_max_light_distance" getter="get_max_light_distance" default="0">
			For faster baking during testing, you can limit the maximum distance at which lights have an effect. However you will get an abrupt cutoff at this limit which can look unsightly. 
			Setting this to 0 disables the limit, and is recommended for final bakes.
			[b]Note:[/b] Only operates with backward tracing.
		</member>
		<member name="meshes" type="NodePath" setter="set_mesh_path" getter="get_mesh_path" default="NodePath(&quot;&quot;)">
			This is the branch which contains the meshes you intend to use for baked lighting. They should be set to 'use in baked light' in the geometry section, if they are to be included.
		</member>
		<member name="mode" type="int" setter="set_mode" getter="get_mode" enum="LLightmap.eMode" default="1">
			Chooses whether to bake lightmaps using forward (from the light) or backward (from the texel) tracing.
		</member>
		<member name="noise method" type="int" setter="set_noise_reduction_method" getter="get_noise_reduction_method" default="2">
			Noise reduction method can be disabled, simple or advanced (using OpenImageDenoise). Advanced noise reduction ignores other noise parameters.
			It takes place as a post process (after merging), so you can make quickly preview changes by merging rather than doing a full bake.
		</member>
		<member name="noise_reduction" type="float" setter="set_noise_reduction" getter="get_noise_reduction" default="1.0">
			Applies simple noise reduction to reduce dithering. This can make the lightmap look 'plastic'. For in progress versions it is a good trade off, for final versions consider a longer bake and turning off noise reduction (set to 0), or applying it in a specialist photo editor afterwards.
			It takes place as a post process (after merging), so you can make quickly preview changes by merging rather than doing a full bake.
		</member>
		<member name="noise_threshold" type="float" setter="set_noise_threshold" getter="get_noise_threshold" default="0.1">
			When applying noise reduction, pixels that are more different than this threshold from their neighbor pixels are considered details, and are preserved without applying noise reduction.
		</member>
		<member name="normalize_multiplier" type="float" setter="set_normalize_multiplier" getter="get_normalize_multiplier" default="4.0">
			In order to prevent the scene being dark, depending on how you are using the lightmap in the shader, it can be a good idea to make the scene overbright. This multiplier is applied during normalization. In the case of png output, the maximum brightness is capped, so you will lose some detail.
		</member>
		<member name="num_bounces" type="int" setter="set_num_bounces" getter="get_num_bounces" default="0">
			Number of bounces to calculate. More bounces gives more realistic indirect lighting, but can increase bake time significantly.
		</member>
		<member name="probe_density" type="int" setter="set_probe_density" getter="get_probe_density" default="64">
			Number of probes on the largest axis of the level. This determines the overall number of probes. Note that the number of probes goes up roughly with the cube of this value.
		</member>
		<member name="probe_samples" type="int" setter="set_probe_samples" getter="get_probe_samples" default="4096">
			Number of samples taken to estimate incoming light at each light probe.
		</member>
		<member name="quality" type="int" setter="set_quality" getter="get_quality" enum="LLightmap.eQuality" default="1">
			Allows quickly modifying several settings for the quality of bake desired. At low quality there will be no bounces.
		</member>
		<member name="roughness" type="float" setter="set_roughness" getter="get_roughness" default="0.5">
			Bounced light can be bounced in random directions (high roughness) or directly mirrored against the surface (low roughness).
		</member>
		<member name="samples" type="int" setter="set_num_samples" getter="get_num_samples" default="32">
			The principal determinant of lightmap quality is the number of samples. A low number of samples gives a noisy appearance, however more samples requires longer baking.
		</member>
		<member name="seam_distance_threshold" type="float" setter="set_seam_distance_threshold" getter="get_seam_distance_threshold" default="0.001">
			Tolerance distance (in world space) for welding vertices that form seams (i.e. two edges). Sometimes the modelling program will introduce small floating point error and this needs to be allowed.
		</member>
		<member name="seam_normal_threshold" type="float" setter="set_seam_normal_threshold" getter="get_seam_normal_threshold" default="45.0">
			Seams as part of a flat or curved surface should be stitched, but those at a sharp angle (e.g. 90 degrees) may not be desired for stitching. You can set the threshold angle here (in degrees), above this angle seams will not be stitched.
		</member>
		<member name="seam_stitching" type="bool" setter="set_seam_stitching" getter="get_seam_stitching" default="true">
			Seam stitching can help prevent ugly artifacts at the seams between UV islands. It takes place as a post process (after merging), so you can make quickly preview changes by merging rather than doing a full bake.
		</member>
		<member name="sky_blur" type="float" setter="set_sky_blur" getter="get_sky_blur" default="0.1">
			When the sky contains a single light source such as the sun, by random chance samples will rarely hit the light source, resulting in very noisy images. It is usually much better to blur the sky texture prior to the sampling stage, so that a cleaner result can be obtained.
			A higher blur value will give a cleaner result in fewer samples, at the expense of detail in the sky.
		</member>
		<member name="sky_filename" type="String" setter="set_sky_filename" getter="get_sky_filename" default="&quot;&quot;">
			You can optionally choose an HDRI type environment texture to light the scene, especially outdoor scenes.
		</member>
		<member name="sky_samples" type="int" setter="set_sky_samples" getter="get_sky_samples" default="512">
			Determines the number of ray samples into the environment to use for sky.
		</member>
		<member name="sky_size" type="int" setter="set_sky_size" getter="get_sky_size" default="256">
			The sky will be reduced in size to approximately these dimensions for sampling, to increase speed.
		</member>
		<member name="surface_bias" type="float" setter="set_surface_bias" getter="get_surface_bias" default="0.005">
			In order to prevent self intersection of rays bounced from surfaces, a small bias is added to the ray start position. The default value should normally work, but just in case there are problems, this can be edited.
		</member>
		<member name="tex_height" type="int" setter="set_tex_height" getter="get_tex_height" default="512">
			Overall texture height. It can sometimes be a good idea to bake final lightmaps at a size 2 - 4x larger than the intended result, then resize them in a photo editor.
		</member>
		<member name="tex_width" type="int" setter="set_tex_width" getter="get_tex_width" default="512">
			Overall texture width. It can sometimes be a good idea to bake final lightmaps at a size 2 - 4x larger than the intended result, then resize them in a photo editor.
		</member>
		<member name="uv_filename" type="String" setter="set_uv_filename" getter="get_uv_filename" default="&quot;&quot;">
			As uv mapping is a destructive process, that also adds information to the meshes scene (vertex count may change, and UVs are added), the uvmapped scene will be saved separately from the source meshes scene. This new scene is automatically loaded to replace the original scene in the scene tree during uvmapping.
		</member>
		<member name="uv_padding" type="int" setter="set_uv_padding" getter="get_uv_padding" default="4">
			When uv mapping it is a good idea to add padding of unused texels around the uv islands. This prevents visual artifacts due to the GPU sampling outside the island, during filtering and mipmapping.
		</member>
		<member name="visualize_seams" type="bool" setter="set_visualize_seams" getter="get_visualize_seams" default="false">
			Draw seams in red (for debugging purposes).
		</member>
		<member name="voxel_density" type="int" setter="set_voxel_density" getter="get_voxel_density" default="20">
			The ray tracer uses a 3d map of cells called 'voxels' to speed up tracing. The best density to use can depend on your scene geometry. A large complex scene can benefit from a higher density, but there can be slowdown with too many voxels. The default is a good balance for small / medium scenes. For larger scenes consider increasing this to 40 or more.

	<constants>
		<constant name="LLightmap::MODE_FORWARD" value="0" enum="eMode">
			Sends rays out from each light randomly. This leads to more physically accurate results, but can be suspectible to noise.
		</constant>
		<constant name="LLightmap::MODE_BACKWARD" value="1" enum="eMode">
			Traces rays back from each texel towards light sources on the first pass. This ensures a good coverage of samples for each texel, but is less representative of real physics.
		</constant>
		<constant name="LLightmap::BAKEMODE_UVMAP" value="0" enum="eBakeMode">
			(Warning - destructive. Make sure you understand how this works with a test project beforehand.)
This creates a UV mapping in the 2nd uv channel for the meshes, and saves the resulting scene in the uv_filename file. It deletes the old meshes scene, and loads the new uv mapped scene in its place. For safety reasons, it automatically creates a backup of your meshes scene called uvmap_backup.tscn in the root of your project. You are strongly advised to keep a backup of your scene prior to uvmapping in case you want to edit it.
		</constant>
		<constant name="LLightmap::BAKEMODE_LIGHTMAP" value="1" enum="eBakeMode">
			This bakes lighting into the lights exr file, then merges just the lights into the combined final file.

			This bakes ambient occlusion into the AO exr file, then merges just the ambient occlusion into the combined final file.
		</constant>
		<constant name="LLightmap::BAKEMODE_MERGE" value="3" enum="eBakeMode">
			This quickly merges existing intermediate ambient occlusion and light files into the combined final file, allowing you to adjust overall brightness and gamma, and the balance between the two.
