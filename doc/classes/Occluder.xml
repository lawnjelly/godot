		Allows [OccluderShape]s to be used for occlusion culling within the portal system.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		As well as occlusion culling using portals, the portal system allows simple geometric primitives to be used as occluders. These are attached to the node as [OccluderShape] resources.
		Multiple primitives can be used within a single shape, this allows a large number of occluders to be placed efficiently.
