		Although [code]Room[/code] behaviour can be specified individually, sometimes it is faster and more convenient to write functionality for a group of rooms. For example a [code]RoomGroup[/code] can be used to group those rooms that are outside, and switch on or off a directional light, or rain effect as the player enters / exits the area.
